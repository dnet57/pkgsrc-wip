webkit-gtk: Update www/webkit-gtk to 2.22.2

pkgsrc changes:
 - Bump GCC_REQD to 6.0 (now gcc 6.0.0 or newer is needed)
 - Add NetBSD support for JavaScript JIT on x86_64, i386, arm,
   aarch64 and mips
 - Add WebKitWebProcess and jsc to NOT_PAX_MPROTECT_SAFE.
   At least on NetBSD/amd64, running SunSpider 1.0.2 JavaScript Benchmark
   (<https://webkit.org/perf/sunspider/sunspider.html>) with MiniBrowser
   and security.pax.mprotect.global=1 needed around:
    Total:                 1006.9ms +/- 0.7%
   ...while after temporary setting security.pax.mprotect.global=0:
    Total:                 322.3ms +/- 3.0%
   (Probably EACCESS due PaX MPROTECT are handled gracefully and
   silently instead of failing hard at runtime.)
   Add WebKitWebProcess and jsc to NOT_PAX_MPROTECT_SAFE to obtain
   the same.  Please also note that webkit-gtk browsers should not
   need any NOT_PAX_MPROTECT_SAFE because WebKitWebProcess is used
   and already had that.
 - Improve handling of `webkit-jit' by introducing a
   WEBKIT_JIT_MACHINE_PLATFORMS list that contain all MACHINE_PLATFORMs
   triplets that have `webkit-jit' option as suggested one.
 - Always use OS(...) and BOS(...) macros instead of __Os__ macros for
   consistency with webkit code.
 - Add definition for BOS(SOLARIS) and OS(SOLARIS) and add it to the
   OS(UNIX) OSes list.
 - Limit patch-Source_JavaScriptCore_jit_ExecutableAllocator.cpp to
   OpenBSD. It is no longer present on FreeBSD ports and it is not
   problematic on NetBSD.
 - Remove no longer needed patch-Source_WTF_wtf_ThreadSpecific.h:
   NetBSD 5.x was already part of NOT_FOR_PLATFORM.
 - Sync patch-CMakeLists.txt with FreeBSD ports.
   Please note that this also remove WTF_CPU_SPARC64 definition that was
   unused.
 - madvise(2) on {Free,DragonFly,Net,Open}BSD has MADV_FREE and
   MADV_DONTNEED flags. Define the corresponding HAVE_* via
   patch-Source_WTF_wtf_Platform.h.
 - Use globbing for REPLACE_{PERL,PYTHON} where possible

Changes:
WebKitGTK+ 2.22.2
=================
  - Several fixes for video playback with media source extensions (MSE).
    This allows using WebM support for YouTube, which no longer works through
    regular video source. Note that MSE is still disabled by default and
    webkit_settings_set_enable_mediasource() has to be used to enable the
    feature.
  - Fix the build when only Wayland support is enabled and X11 headers are
    not available.

WebKitGTK+ 2.22.1
=================
  - Fix printing in landscape.
  - Fix the build in several platforms: s390x, ppc64le, armv7hl.
  - Fix the build with a11y disabled.
  - Fix the build with video disabled.
  - Fix several crashes and rendering issues.

WebKitGTK+ 2.22.0
==================
  - Add warn_unused_result attribute to some JavaScriptCore GLib APIs.
  - Make pinch to zoom scale the page without changing the layout.
  - Fix the build in mips64.
