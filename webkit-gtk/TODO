- Review JIT support for NetBSD:
   * patches/patch-Source_JavaScriptCore_runtime_MachineContext.h
   * patches/patch-Source_WTF_wtf_Platform.h
  Only amd64 and i386 was actually tested and it would be nice if arm, arm64
  and mips can get some testing.
- Could the NetBSD logic in
  patches/patch-Source_JavaScriptCore_runtime_MachineContext.h be rewritten
  using ucontext(2) _UC_MACHINE_* macros instead?
- Would it be useful to define HAVE_BACKTRACE and HAVE_BACKTRACE_SYMBOLS?
  (these are not probably per-OS but just a matter of include devel/libexecinfo
  and adjust Source/WTF/wtf/Platform.h)
- Possible other HAVE_* that we can define in Source/WTF/wtf/Platform.h:
   #define HAVE_READLINE 1    (add readline(3) support to jsc)
