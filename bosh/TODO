[X] Analyze test target failure on NetBSD
    Reason: NetBSD od has trailing whitespace in its output
    => Fix added for current version
    => Reported to upstream, next release will contain a workaround
    => Updated to release 2018-09-26 and patch removed
[X] Analyze keyboard behaviour for Delete and Backspace
    => Different behaviour (compared to ash and bash) is documented
[X] Add obosh and pbosh variants to this package?
    => No, use separate packages
[X] Use smake for build
[X] Analyze keyboard behaviour for special characters like umlauts
    => setlocale() is not called by the shell (and therefore iswprint() fails)
       Reason: "/usr/lib/locale" is expected to exist, but not there on NetBSD
    => Patch added
    => Problem reported upstream
