swi-prolog*: Update lang/swi-prolog* to 7.6.4

pkgsrc changes:
 - Add patches/patch-src_os_pl-files.c to avoid overlapping `src'
   and `dst' in srtcpy(3).  It is an undefined behaviour and it leads to build
   issue in swi-prolog-packages on platforms that uses SSP.
 - readline dependency is no longer needed for swi-prolog-lite.
   The readline functionality is now provided as a package via
   swi-prolog-packages.
 - Inject CFLAGS via COFLAGS and pass -fPIC via CMFLAGS so that
   swi-prolog-jpl will link
 - Add patches/patch-src_pl-rsort.c to use FreeBSD qsort_r(3)
   instead of using nested functions. This is probably more portable
   and has less problems (e.g. does not need for PaX MPROTECT).
