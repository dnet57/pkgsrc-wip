HAXM is a hardware-assisted virtualization engine (hypervisor) that uses Intel
Virtualization Technology to speed up IA (x86/ x86_64) emulation on a host
machine running Windows or macOS. It started as an Android SDK component, but
has recently transformed itself into a general accelerator for QEMU.
