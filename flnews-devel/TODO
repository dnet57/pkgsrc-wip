[X] Create reproducible build
[X] Include mk/pthread.buildlink3.mk (similar to FLTK)
[X] Force POSIX.1 IP6 on NetBSD (if inet6 option is selected)
    Reason: Autodetect via POSIX sysconf(_SC_IPV6) doesn't work on NetBSD
[X] Suggest option inet6
[X] Add help message for NLS (supported locale codesets)
[X] Suggest option nls?
    Yes => Even without NLS the FILTER module limits supported locale codesets
[X] Execute "make config" part of build in the pkgsrc configure phase
[ ] Check handling of CPPFLAGS
[ ] Import final flnews 0.16 release
[ ] Switch back to FLTK version from pkgsrc current
